<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center;"><strong><em>Designing T-shirt</em></strong></h2>
<p style="color:yellow;">Well, you need the Creative Process. 
Get paper and pencil first. Design is always fabulous in your mind. The computer screen may limit your imagination. Label the paper Phase 1. Before sketching anything, read the mission and vision of your university, and try to imagine a bright future of the mission and vision. Think of the words progress, innovation, advancement, and the like. In my case, I listen to a track "Skyscapes 2" (as I draw) so that I can imagine more of what the future would be like. Why the future? It's where we're headed to, and we ought not put into our design that would easily become obsolete. 

Try to sketch now. Try to incorporate colors if you would. It doesn't need to be detailed. Remember, this is Phase I. After you've finished the rough sketch, stand back. A design must be good to look from afar. Then ask the question: Is this relevant to the university? If placed on t-shirt, will it make a good design? (note that not all designs are good to look at when placed on t-shirt. there are those that are awfully placed. remember never to place circles on either left or right.) Will the color of the shirt highlight the design? Are the elements of the mission and vision present? 

One thing I've learned is to always observe multiple designs before you do your own. Though not real, you want to come up with a better design than what you've seen. That's where innovation begins. Also, I have this habit of writing down all the elements I want to be incorporated so that I won't miss anything for the design. 

Then there's the colors. Try to look at a color palette. Do you want contrast? harmony? Colors opposite each other on the color wheel make very strong contrast. Now, you wouldn't want to have true green and classic red to be on the design. Such contrasts are bad for the eyes. 

After you've chosen the colors, it may be time to face the computer. Well, not really. Redraw your design, this time with enough details and labels for colors. Then the computer. 

T-shirt designs are best when they're vector arts. That is, no gradients, no shadows, etc. Just flat but clever. (If you would, type-in at Google: clever logos or innovative logos) 

After finishing, stand back again. (Sometimes, you need to let time pass so that you can say the result is satisfactory. The next day you look at the design, you might realize it lacks creativity or thinking.) Well then, after standing back, are you satisfied with the design? Whether you are or are not, set aside the project. Proceed to Phase 2. 

In Phase 2, your goal is to make a better design than the first you did. Repeat the all the steps like the first one, this time with 'something fresh, delighting and new' in mind. 

After sketching and designing with the computer, stand back again. This time, show your work to some people you can trust (those who are frank when they comment). Compare Phase 1 and Phase 2. Pick your choice, and let them pick their choice too. If the choice matches, that's it. If not, do something like Phase 1.1 or Phase 1.2. If necessary, do Phase 3. 

Your final work should be satisfactory, and your viewers should be satisfied too. Then, you're ready to relax.</p>
